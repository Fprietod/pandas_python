Inventory


6.
Add a column to inventory called in_stock which is True if quantity is greater than 0 and False if quantity equals 0.

7.
Petal Power wants to know how valuable their current inventory is.

Create a column called total_value that is equal to price multiplied by quantity.

8.
The Marketing department wants a complete description of each product for their catalog.

The following lambda function combines product_type and product_description into a single string:
```python 
combine_lambda = lambda row: \
    '{} - {}'.format(row.product_type,
                     row.product_description)
```

Using combine_lambda, create a new column in inventory called full_description that has the complete description of each product.

Code:
```python 
import pandas as pd 

# 1 Parte
inventory = pd.read_csv('inventory.csv')
# 2 parte
print(inventory.head(10))
# 3 parte
staten_island = inventory.head(10)
# 4 parte 
product_request = staten_island.product_description
# 5 parte 
seed_request = inventory[(inventory.location == "Brooklyn") & (inventory.product_type == "seeds")]
# 6 Parte
inventory["in_stock"] = inventory.apply(lambda row: True if row.quantity > 0 else False, axis = 1)
print(inventory.head(10))
# 7 Parte 
inventory['total_value'] = inventory.apply(lambda x: x.price * x.quantity, axis = 1)
print(inventory.head(10))
# 8 parte 
combine_lambda = lambda row: \
    '{} - {}'.format(row.product_type,
                     row.product_description)
# 9 Parte
inventory['full_description'] = inventory.apply(combine_lambda, axis = 1)
print(inventory.head(10))
```
