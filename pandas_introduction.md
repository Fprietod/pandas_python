# Create a Data Frame I 
~~~
A DataFrame is an object that stores data as rows and columns. You can think of a DataFrame as a spreadsheet or as a SQL table. You can manually create a DataFrame or fill it with data from a CSV, an Excel spreadsheet, or a SQL query.

DataFrames have rows and columns. Each column has a name, which is a string. Each row has an index, which is an integer. DataFrames can contain many different data types: strings, ints, floats, tuples, etc.

You can pass in a dictionary to pd.DataFrame(). Each key is a column name and each value is a list of column values. The columns must all be the same length or you will get an error. Hereâ€™s an example:
~~~
```python
df1 = pd.DataFrame({
    'name': ['John Smith', 'Jane Doe', 'Joe Schmo'],
    'address': ['123 Main St.', '456 Maple Ave.', '789 Broadway'],
    'age': [34, 28, 51]
})

```
