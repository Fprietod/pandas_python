### Calculating Column Statistics
Aggregate functions summarize many data points (i.e., a column of a dataframe) into a smaller set of values.

Some examples of this type of calculation include:

The DataFrame customers contains the names and ages of all of your customers. You want to find the median age:
```python 
print(customers.age)
>> [23, 25, 31, 35, 35, 46, 62]
print(customers.age.median())
>> 35
```
The DataFrame shipments contains address information for all shipments that youâ€™ve sent out in the past year. You want to know how many different states you have shipped to (and how many shipments went to the same state).
```python 
print(shipments.state)
>> ['CA', 'CA', 'CA', 'CA', 'NY', 'NY', 'NJ', 'NJ', 'NJ', 'NJ', 'NJ', 'NJ', 'NJ']
print(shipments.state.nunique())
>> 3
``` 
The DataFrame inventory contains a list of types of t-shirts that your company makes. You want a list of the colors that your shirts come in.
```python 
print(inventory.color)
>> ['blue', 'blue', 'blue', 'blue', 'blue', 'green', 'green', 'orange', 'orange', 'orange']
print(inventory.color.unique())
>> ['blue', 'green', 'orange']
```
The general syntax for these calculations is:
```python 
df.column_name.command()
```

| Command   | Description                       |
| --------- | --------------------------------- |
| `mean`    | Average of all values in column   |
| `std`     | Standard deviation                |
| `median`  | Median                            |
| `max`     | Maximum value in column           |
| `min`     | Minimum value in column           |
| `count`   | Number of values in column        |
| `nunique` | Number of unique values in column |
| `unique`  | List of unique values in column   |

Our finance department wants to know the price of the most expensive pair of shoes purchased. Save your answer to the variable most_expensive.
```python most_expensive = orders.price.max()
```

Our fashion department wants to know how many different colors of shoes we are selling. Save your answer to the variable num_colors.
```python 
num_colors = orders.shoe_color.nunique()
```
